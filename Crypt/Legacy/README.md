# Legacy

The hall of fame for retired champions 🏆

These designs actually made it to production and lived to tell the tale.
They've been replaced by newer, shinier versions, but they deserve respect for their service.

Keep them around for nostalgia, reference, or that inevitable "why did we change this again?" conversation.

## How to contribute

Read-only, my friend.

The only acceptable move is graduating designs from Vault to here when they get retired.
No updates, no tweaks, no "just one more thing" - let them rest in peace.
