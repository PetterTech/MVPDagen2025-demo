# Crypt

Welcome to the final resting place ⚰️

This is where all designs come when their time is up - whether they went out in a blaze of glory or never got off the ground.

No active work happens here, but we keep everything for posterity (and to learn from our mistakes).

We make an important distinction:
- **Graveyard**: Ideas that never made it. The rejected, the abandoned, the "what were we thinking?"
- **Legacy**: The veterans. Designs that actually shipped and ran in production before being retired.

## How to contribute

Nothing to contribute here, chief. This is the end of the line.

The only traffic allowed is one-way:
- Spark or Forge → Graveyard (for the failures)
- Vault → Legacy (for the retired champions)

That's it. No resurrecting the dead.
