The hall of records ðŸ”’

This is where designs go when they're running in production.
They're locked, sealed, and doing their job in the real world.

By the time something lands here, it's often moved to its own repo alongside the actual code.
If that's the case, you'll find a README.md here with a forwarding address.

## How to contribute

You don't, really.

These designs are set in stone (or at least concrete).
If you absolutely need to fix a typo or update a diagram, talk to the issue owner.
Otherwise, hands off - what's in production stays in production.
