We use mermaid to make simple, conceptual diagrams of the design. The diagrams we make will be of the type flowchart.

All design documents are stored in README.md files within their respective project folders.
All design documents shall have a scope section that describes what the design is about and what it will not cover.
All design documents shall have a rationale section that explains why the design is made the way it is. The rationale should be written in a way that is easy to understand for someone who is not an expert in the field.
All design documents shall have a alternatives considered section that describes the alternatives that were considered and why they were not chosen. The alternatives should be listed in a table, written in a way that is easy to understand for someone who is not an expert in the field.
All design documents shall have a conceptual design section that includes a mermaid diagram. The diagram should show the main components of the design and how they are connected. The diagram should be simple and easy to understand.
All design documents shall have a logical design section that includes a diagram, this may or may not be made in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com).

Design shall follow this lifecycle strictly:

- Spark: Initial ideas, rough sketches, brainstorming charts.
- Forge: Actively worked on designs, tied to issues or projects.
- Vault: Locked in designs in production, possibly moved to a new repo.
- Legacy: Old, obsolete, or retired designs.
- Graveyard: Discarded or rejected designs.

Designs can move directly from any Spark or Forge to the Graveyard if they are discarded or rejected, but can only move to Legacy if they have been in Vault or otherwise in production.

Markdown code should follow following rules:

- One sentence per line
- Links should be formatted as [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
- Headings should be surrounded by blank lines
- Bullet points should have a blank line before and after
- No trailing spaces
- End each file with a newline
