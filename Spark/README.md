# Spark

The napkin sketch zone âœ¨

This is where half-baked ideas live.
Rough sketches from workshops, hackathon doodles, that thing you drew on a whiteboard at 2am - it all goes here.

Nothing formal, nothing polished.
Just raw ideas waiting for someone to care about them.

These designs aren't actively being worked on, so don't expect issues or project tracking.
They're just... vibes.

## How to contribute

Zero barriers to entry.

Create a branch, throw your stuff in, and submit a merge request.
We prefer [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or mermaid diagrams, but honestly?
Napkin photos, PowerPoint exports, ASCII art - we'll take it all.

See something you like and want to actually build it?
Move it to Forge, give it a proper README.md, and boom - you've ignited a spark! ðŸ”¥
