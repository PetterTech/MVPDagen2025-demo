# Spark - Agent Instructions

## Purpose

The Spark folder contains initial ideas, rough sketches, and brainstorming charts.
Designs here are in the earliest stage of development.

## Working with Spark Designs

### Expectations

- Designs in Spark are exploratory and experimental
- Documentation may be incomplete or rough
- Multiple alternatives can coexist
- Focus is on capturing ideas rather than perfect documentation

### Creating New Spark Designs

When creating a new design in Spark:

- Create a new folder with a descriptive name using PascalCase
- Add a README.md file with at least a scope section
- Include rough conceptual diagrams if helpful
- Don't worry about completeness - this is brainstorming stage

### Transitioning Designs

Designs can move from Spark to:

- **Forge**: When the design becomes actively worked on and tied to an issue or project
- **Graveyard**: When the idea is discarded or rejected

### Documentation Requirements

Spark designs have relaxed documentation requirements:

- Scope section is recommended but not mandatory
- Rationale and alternatives sections can be minimal or skipped
- Diagrams should be simple conceptual sketches
- Focus on capturing the core idea

## Current Spark Designs

Refer to the README.md in each subfolder for specific design details.
