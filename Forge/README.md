The workshop where ideas get hammered into shape ðŸ”¨

This is where rough sketches evolve into actual designs.
If it's here, someone's actively working on it and it's tied to real work - an issue, user story, or epic.

Each design lives in its own README.md file that explains:
- What problem we're solving
- Why we're doing it this way
- How the pieces fit together

Copy from the issue if you're lazy, or write it fresh if you're feeling inspired.

## How to contribute

Got ideas? Love it!

You can absolutely create a branch and submit a merge request, but honestly?
Just reach out to whoever owns the issue and have a conversation.
Design is better when it's collaborative, not just a series of PRs.
