# Forge - Agent Instructions

## Purpose

The Forge folder contains designs that are actively being worked on.
These designs are tied to issues or projects and are in active development.

## Working with Forge Designs

### Expectations

- Designs in Forge are actively being developed and refined
- Documentation should be comprehensive and follow all standards
- Each design should be tied to an issue or project
- Regular updates are expected as work progresses

### Creating New Forge Designs

When creating a new design in Forge:

- Create a new folder with a descriptive name using PascalCase
- Add a complete README.md file with all required sections
- Link the design to relevant issues or projects
- Ensure all diagrams are clear and professional

### Documentation Requirements

Forge designs must follow all documentation standards:

- **Scope section**: Required - clearly define what is in and out of scope
- **Rationale section**: Required - explain design decisions thoroughly
- **Alternatives considered section**: Required - document alternatives in a table format
- **Conceptual design section**: Required - include a mermaid flowchart diagram
- **Logical design section**: Required - include detailed diagrams (Excalidraw or similar)

### Transitioning Designs

Designs can move from Forge to:

- **Vault**: When the design is implemented and moved to production
- **Graveyard**: When the design is abandoned or rejected
- **Spark**: If the design needs to be reconsidered (rare)
